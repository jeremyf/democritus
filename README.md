# Democritus

Democritus is a plugin for building class from reusable components.

Democritus is inspired as followup of a common pattern that I saw in the development of [Sipity's](https://github.com/ndlib/sipity/) form objects.
It also aims to address the needs of Sipity's yet to be developed sibling application; The dissemination of processed data.
